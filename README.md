# Opinionated Laravel Skeleon

### A opinionated skeleton for Laravel projects based on my own preferences.

It includes the following:

- Moved Routes
- Removed Health Checks Routes
- FrankenPHP Dockerfile with Caddyfile
- Modified composer.json to install Nodejs Packages
- Modified [.gitignore](.gitignore)

### Added Packages

Look at [composer.json](composer.json)

### Create a new Project with this Skeleton

```bash
composer create-project simonjenny/laravel-skeleton NAME
```
